## Environment 
- **Privileges**: You have sudo access when needed.
- **SQL**: This is aiosqlite.
- **Browser**: Do not use the browser

## Strict Rules

1. **Read first**: Always read and understand the full code context before making suggestions.
2. **Report, don't fix**: Identify and report issues only. Do not implement fixes unless explicitly asked.
3. **Always do git push**: Always push to GitHub unless explicitly instructed. Use `casescope` user for SSH operations. Commit all first.
4. **No markdown files**: Do not create `.md` files unless specifically requested. Keep the readme.md up to date.

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
